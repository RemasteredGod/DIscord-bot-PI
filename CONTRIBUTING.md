## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines

    """
    Retrieve current system statistics.
    
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing CPU temp, usage, RAM, and disk stats
    """
    try:
        # Implementation here
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error getting system stats: {e}")
        return {}
```

## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork:
